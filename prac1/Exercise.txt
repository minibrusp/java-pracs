Certainly! Here's a coding challenge to practice classes and objects in Java:

Task: Bank Account Management
Create a simple Java program to manage bank accounts. Define two classes: BankAccount and Bank.

Now, create a Bank object, add a few BankAccount objects to it, and perform some transactions like deposits and withdrawals. Display the account information after each transaction.

This challenge will help you practice creating and using classes, handling methods, and managing objects in Java. Feel free to extend the functionality or add additional features to make it more interesting!
